# Titanic-notebook-10-model-tuning and ensembling with visualisations
 This study makes data visualisations of Titanic data and using that data predicts which passengers would survive from the Titanic disaster by means of machine learning modelling techniques. It presents a full machine learning work flow, use 10 Machine Learning algorithms, tune their parameters and ensemble the best n (e.g. 6) of them using their accuracy scores for the validation set.
